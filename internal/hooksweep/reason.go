// Package hooksweep holds the hook-staleness cycle: the judgement of persisted
// hook keys against the live pane tokens that protect them, the conditions that
// forbid that judgement, and the vocabulary a caller reports either in. It owns
// the whole cycle's emission — its counts, its stand-downs and its failures
// alike ride the hooks component, whichever caller drove it — so a caller keeps
// only the rendering its own surface owes.
package hooksweep

// Reason is the closed vocabulary of reasons a cycle declined to run under.
// It is a type rather than a convention over plain strings so no string-typed
// value can be reported as one; an untyped constant still converts implicitly.
type Reason string

// The reasons a cycle declined to run under, which the logged reason attr also
// names. Every surface that renders one works from this set, so their
// vocabularies cannot drift from it. A sweep that ran and failed is not among
// them: it declined nothing.

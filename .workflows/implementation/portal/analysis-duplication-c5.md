AGENT: duplication
FINDINGS: none
SUMMARY: No new duplication introduced by cycle 4 changes. The detect.go extraction is clean. PathOpener and its supporting types in open.go do not duplicate existing patterns at a scale warranting extraction. Previously discarded low-severity findings (reload closure, window pluralization) remain unchanged and below threshold.

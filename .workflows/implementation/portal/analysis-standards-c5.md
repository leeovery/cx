AGENT: standards
FINDINGS: none
SUMMARY: All cycle 4 findings resolved. GoReleaser config now matches the tick reference pattern (formats: [tar.gz], files: [none*], changelog: disable: true, release: draft: false, no homebrew_casks). Workflow correctly extracts checksums and dispatches to homebrew-tools via CICD_PAT. Implementation files conform to specification and project conventions.

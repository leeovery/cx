# Review Tracking: Portal - Traceability

## Findings

No findings. The plan is a faithful, complete translation of the specification.

All cycle 1 fixes have been properly applied:
- Project picker filter mode added to portal-2-6 (Finding 1)
- TUI fallback with pre-filled session list filter added to portal-4-5 (Finding 2)
- Phase 3 tasks expanded with full template fields (Finding 3)
- Phase 4 tasks expanded with full template fields (Finding 4)
- Session sorting explicitly documented in portal-1-3 (Finding 5)

Direction 1 (Spec to Plan): Every specification element -- decisions, requirements, edge cases, constraints, data models, integration points, and validation rules -- has corresponding plan coverage with sufficient implementation detail.

Direction 2 (Plan to Spec): Every task traces back to the specification. No hallucinated content, invented requirements, or undocumented technical approaches found.

# Discussion: Theming System

## Context

Portal's TUI is already tokenised: `internal/tui/theme` holds ~20 semantic role
tokens (`Token{Name, Light, Dark}`), every renderer references a token rather
than raw hex, and `theme.MV` is the single built-in "Modern Vivid" palette. The
layout is fixed; only the colour layer is parameterised. So this work is not
building a theming system from nothing — it is changing **where token values
come from** and adding **a surface to switch them**.

Four deliverables arrived together from two inbox ideas taken as one feature:

- Load token values from config rather than code (user-overridable themes).
- Ship at least one additional built-in theme so Portal launches with genuine
  options, not a single palette.
- Add an in-app theme selector with live preview — Lee's picture is a TUI
  "slide-over" overlaying the right-hand strip, arrowing the list re-theming the
  main view live behind it (a modal blanks the screen to the canvas, so a modal
  picker has nothing to preview against).
- Settle the border token names (`border.separator` / `border.footer` — named
  after their first use-site, not their intrinsic weight) **before** the token
  names become the public contract a user themes against.

Research is complete and unusually decisive on feasibility. Live re-theming
works: call sites resolve tokens at render time, and `applyCanvasMode` already
performs exactly the mid-session restyle a theme swap needs. The non-blanking
right-hand overlay already ships (`overlayHelpOnPreview`, lipgloss v2
`Compositor` with real z-layers). Detection works both ways — OSC 11 (terminal
background) and DEC mode 2031 (OS colour scheme) are both plumbed end-to-end in
Portal's dependency stack.

What research deliberately did *not* settle is the decision set. It flagged its
own convergence — several threads landed on positions that belong to this phase
to ratify or overturn, not to inherit as settled.

## What is this?

A complete development workflow for Claude Code: explore ideas, capture decisions, build actionable plans, implement via strict TDD, and validate the result.

Use it as a **six-phase workflow** or pick individual capabilities as needed:

```
Research → Discussion → Specification → Planning → Implementation → Review
```

**Why this matters:** Complex features benefit from thorough discussion before implementation. This toolkit documents the *what* and *why* before diving into the *how*, preserving architectural decisions, edge cases, and the reasoning behind choices that would otherwise be lost.

**Flexible entry points:** Need the full workflow? Start at Research or Discussion and progress through each phase. Already know what you're building? Jump straight to Specification with `/start-feature`. Skills are input-agnostic - commands gather context and feed it to them.

> [!NOTE]
> **Work in progress.** The workflow is being refined through real-world usage. Expect updates as patterns evolve.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Model compatibility:** These skills have been developed and refined for Claude Code running on **Opus 4.5**. Different models may exhibit different edge cases, and future model releases may require adjustments to the prompts and workflows.

### Quick Install

**Marketplace** (cached globally):
```
/plugin marketplace add leeovery/claude-plugins-marketplace
/plugin install claude-technical-workflows@claude-plugins-marketplace
```

**npm** (copied to your repo):
```bash
npm install -D @leeovery/claude-technical-workflows
```

See [Installation](#installation) for details and trade-offs.

## How do I use it?

### Two Ways to Use the Skills

**1. Full Workflow** - Sequential phases that build on each other:

```
Research → Discussion → Specification → Planning → Implementation → Review
```

Start with `/start-research` or `/start-discussion` and follow the flow. Each phase outputs files that the next phase consumes.

**2. Standalone Commands** - Jump directly to a skill with flexible inputs:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/start-feature` | Create a spec directly from inline context (skip research/discussion) |

*More standalone commands coming soon.*

### The Command/Skill Architecture

**Skills are input-agnostic.** They don't know or care where their inputs came from: a discussion document, inline context, or external sources. They just process what they receive.

**Commands are the input layer.** They gather context (from files, prompts, or inline) and pass it to skills. This separation means:

- The same skill can be invoked from different entry points
- You can create custom commands that feed skills in new ways
- Skills remain reusable without coupling to specific workflows

```

### Workflow Commands

| Phase          | Command                 |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| Research       | `/start-research`       |
| Discussion     | `/start-discussion`     |
| Specification  | `/start-specification`  |
| Planning       | `/start-planning`       |
| Implementation | `/start-implementation` |
| Review         | `/start-review`         |

Run the command directly or ask Claude to run it. Each gathers context from previous phase outputs and passes it to the skill.

## Installation

| Method          | Where files live                    | Best for                                        |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Marketplace** | `~/.claude/plugins/` (global cache) | Quick setup, don't need files in repo           |
| **npm**         | `.claude/` in your project          | Ownership, version control, Claude Code for Web |

### Option 1: Claude Marketplace

```
/plugin marketplace add leeovery/claude-plugins-marketplace
/plugin install claude-technical-workflows@claude-plugins-marketplace
```

Skills are cached globally. They won't be available in Claude Code for Web since files aren't in your repository.

### Option 2: npm

```bash
npm install -D @leeovery/claude-technical-workflows
```

Skills are copied to `.claude/` and can be committed, giving you ownership and making them available everywhere including Claude Code for Web.

<details>
<summary>pnpm users</summary>

pnpm doesn't expose binaries from transitive dependencies, so install the manager directly:

```bash
pnpm add -D @leeovery/claude-manager @leeovery/claude-technical-workflows
pnpm approve-builds  # approve when prompted
pnpm install         # triggers postinstall
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Removal (npm/pnpm)</summary>

Due to bugs in npm 7+ ([issue #3042](https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/3042)) and pnpm ([issue #3276](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/3276)), preuninstall hooks don't run reliably. Remove files manually first:

```bash
npx claude-manager remove @leeovery/claude-technical-workflows && npm rm @leeovery/claude-technical-workflows
```
</details>

## The Six-Phase Workflow

When using the full workflow, it progresses through six distinct phases:

```

```

**Phase 1 - Research:** Explore ideas from their earliest seed. Investigate market fit, technical feasibility, business viability. Free-flowing exploration that may or may not lead to building something.

**Phase 2 - Discussion:** Captures the back-and-forth exploration of a problem. Documents competing solutions, why certain approaches won or lost, edge cases discovered, and the journey to decisions, not just the decisions themselves.

**Phase 3 - Specification:** Transforms discussion(s) into validated, standalone specifications. Automatically analyses multiple discussions for natural groupings, filters hallucinations and inaccuracies, enriches gaps, and builds documents that planning can execute against without referencing other sources.

**Phase 4 - Planning:** Converts specifications into actionable implementation plans with phases, tasks, and acceptance criteria. Supports multiple output formats (local markdown, Linear, Backlog.md).

**Phase 5 - Implementation:** Executes the plan using strict TDD. Writes tests first, implements to pass, commits frequently, and stops for user approval between phases.

**Phase 6 - Review:** Validates completed work against specification requirements and plan acceptance criteria. The specification is the validated source of truth; earlier phases may contain rejected ideas that were intentionally filtered out. Provides structured feedback without fixing code directly.

## Project Structure

### Output Files

Documents are stored in your project using a **phase-first** organisation:

```
docs/workflow/
├── research/              # Phase 1 - flat, semantically named files
│   ├── exploration.md
│   ├── competitor-analysis.md
│   └── pricing-models.md
├── discussion/            # Phase 2 - one file per topic
│   └── {topic}.md
├── specification/         # Phase 3 - one file per topic
│   └── {topic}.md
└── planning/              # Phase 4 - one file per topic
    └── {topic}.md
```

Research starts with `exploration.md` and splits into topic files as themes emerge. From discussion onwards, each topic gets its own file per phase.

## Skills

Skills are **input-agnostic processors**: they receive inputs and process them without knowing where the inputs came from. This makes them reusable across different commands and workflows.

| Skill                                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| [**technical-planning**](skills/technical-planning/)             | Transform specifications into actionable implementation plans with phases, tasks, and acceptance criteria. Supports multiple output formats.                                                                 |
| [**technical-implementation**](skills/technical-implementation/) | Execute implementation plans using strict TDD workflow. Writes tests first, implements to pass, commits frequently, and gates phases on user approval.                                                       |
| [**technical-review**](skills/technical-review/)                 | Review completed implementation against specification requirements and plan acceptance criteria. Uses parallel subagents for efficient chain verification. Produces structured feedback without fixing code. |

## Commands

Commands are the input layer: they gather context and pass it to skills. Two types:

### Workflow Commands

Sequential commands in `commands/workflow/`. They expect files from previous phases and pass content to skills.

| Command                                                                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**/start-research**](commands/workflow/start-research.md)                  | Begin research exploration. For early-stage ideas, feasibility checks, and broad exploration before formal discussion.                                                                                     |
| [**/start-discussion**](commands/workflow/start-discussion.md)              | Begin a new technical discussion. Gathers topic, context, background information, and relevant codebase areas before starting documentation.                                                               |
| [**/start-specification**](commands/workflow/start-specification.md)        | Start a specification session from existing discussion(s). Automatically analyses multiple discussions for natural groupings and consolidates them into unified specifications.                            |
| [**/start-planning**](commands/workflow/start-planning.md)                  | Start a planning session from an existing specification. Creates implementation plans with phases, tasks, and acceptance criteria. Supports multiple output formats (markdown, Linear, Backlog.md, Beads). |
| [**/start-implementation**](commands/workflow/start-implementation.md)      | Start implementing a plan. Executes tasks via strict TDD, committing after each passing test.                                                                                                              |
| [**/start-review**](commands/workflow/start-review.md)                      | Start reviewing completed work. Validates implementation against plan tasks and acceptance criteria.                                                                                                        |

### Utility Commands

Helpers for navigating and maintaining the workflow.

| Command                                                                              | Description                                                                                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**/migrate**](commands/migrate.md)                                         | Keep workflow files in sync with the current system design. Runs automatically at the start of every workflow command.                      |
| [**/status**](commands/workflow/status.md)                                  | Show workflow status - what topics exist at each phase, and suggested next steps.                                                           |
| [**/view-plan**](commands/workflow/view-plan.md)                            | View a plan's tasks and progress, regardless of output format.                                                                              |

### Standalone Commands

Independent commands that gather inputs flexibly (inline context, files, or prompts) and invoke skills directly. Use these when you want skill capabilities without the full workflow structure.

| Command                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**/start-feature**](commands/start-feature.md)         | Create a specification directly from inline context. Invokes the specification skill without requiring a discussion document.              |
| [**/link-dependencies**](commands/link-dependencies.md) | Link external dependencies across topics. Scans plans and wires up unresolved cross-topic dependencies.                                    |

### Creating Custom Commands

Since skills are input-agnostic, you can create your own commands that feed them in new ways. A command just needs to:

1. Gather the inputs the skill expects
2. Invoke the skill with those inputs

See `/start-feature` as an example: it provides inline context to the specification skill instead of a discussion document.

## Agents

Subagents that skills can spawn for parallel task execution.

| Agent                                          | Used By          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**chain-verifier**](agents/chain-verifier.md) | technical-review | Verifies a single plan task was implemented correctly. Checks implementation, tests (not under/over-tested), and code quality. Multiple chain-verifiers run in parallel to verify ALL tasks efficiently. |
